**Exact functional formulas for restricted coprime representations of even integers**

This repository provides a reference Python implementation of the explicit functional formulas developed in the paper

> *Explicit Functional Formulas for Restricted Coprime Representations of Even Integers*  
> Andrés M. Salazar

The code implements the functional framework introduced in the article, including:
- the canonical remainder operator,
- the functional Euclidean algorithm,
- the explicit minimal solutions of functional equations,
- and the closed-form counting formulas for coprime representations of even integers.


## Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- No external dependencies (only standard library modules: `math`, `functools`)

---

## Basic usage

### Direct execution

```bash
python coprime_count.py
